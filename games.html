    <div><h1>_   ALS Level   _</h1>
      <p>To the left is a video of my final level for my MI330 Level Design class. The goal of this level was to create a three part level: an infiltration stage, a stealth stage, and an escape stage. We were given an ALS template as well as blueprints and some prefabs to help us with creating the level. In this project I did not code anything, all code was done by Jeremy Bond, my professor at the time. I modeled most assets in the level of the landscape, building, cubicles, elevator, and the helicopter. I did not model the enemy or player characters, the collectibles(the cookie and the Rhino), or the bow. This was a multi week project. If you want to see my thoughts going through each stage weekly here is a link to a shortened<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13fQECiatAHgqpKWwrRXDrDOirQ2Ctt8YhXZLrJ_BRK0/edit?tab=t.0"> ALS Level Design Journal</a></p>
