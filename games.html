    <div><h1>_   ALS Level   _</h1>
      <p>To the left is a video of my final level for my MI330 Level Design class. The goal of this level was to create a three part level: an infiltration stage, a stealth stage, and an escape stage. We were given an ALS template as well as blueprints and some prefabs to help us with creating the level. In this project I did not code anything, all code was done by Jeremy Bond, my professor at the time. I modeled most assets in the level of the landscape, building, cubicles, elevator, and the helicopter. I did not model the enemy or player characters, the collectibles(the cookie and the Rhino), or the bow. This was a multi week project. If you want to see my thoughts going through each stage weekly here is a link to a shortened<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13fQECiatAHgqpKWwrRXDrDOirQ2Ctt8YhXZLrJ_BRK0/edit?tab=t.0"> ALS Level Design Journal</a></p>

  <div> <h1>_  Pumpkin Panic  _</h1>
  <p>To the Left is a trailer of a game I made in a group for my MI445 class project 2. My role was Lead designer I was in charge of coming up with ideas and helping the other members of the team implement them in a way that is friendly to the player. this game is a shop sim with a little rougelike aspect of an upgrade system using Tarot cards. All of the customers of the game are controlled by Chat GPT prompts that we mapped out by giving prompts on how to act, what to ask, and how it should respond when the picture of the carved pumpkin is sent to Chat GPT. This is a link to the game on Itch.io<a href="https://johntopo.itch.io/pumpkin-panic">Pumpkin Panic</a> this will give you more information about the team and the game, but in order to play you will need your own Chat GPT key. This is a link to the document that lays out what I did in more detail<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zR8SQF1vKOQpVGQf-eojeAPE7JLuhYPJ9oM6Jpfnz7c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9oaydviakufs">Pumpkin Panic Design Journal</a>.</p> </div>
